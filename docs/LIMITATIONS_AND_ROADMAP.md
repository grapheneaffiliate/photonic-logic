# Limitations and Roadmap

## Current Limitations

### 1. Idealized Mode Overestimation
**Issue**: The idealized mode may overestimate performance metrics compared to real-world fabrication constraints.

**Impact**: 
- Extinction ratios calculated in idealized mode may not be achievable in practice
- Power consumption estimates may be optimistic
- Thermal effects may be underestimated

**Recommendation**: Use realistic mode for fabrication-ready designs:
```python
# For production designs, always use realistic mode
python -m plogic demo --platform Si --er-mode realistic
```

### 2. Limited Fanout Capability
**Current State**: System is optimized for fanout=1 (single output per gate)

**Limitations**:
- Cannot efficiently handle parallel signal distribution
- Depth optimization is limited without fanout>1 support
- Power scaling is suboptimal for complex logic networks

**Potential Improvements with Fanout>1**:
- Circuit depth could potentially be halved
- Better parallelism in logic operations
- More efficient power distribution

### 3. Single Material Platform Constraint
**Current State**: Each simulation uses a single material platform (Si, SiN, or AlGaAs)

**Limitations**:
- Cannot leverage the strengths of different materials in a single design
- Missing opportunities for optimized hybrid architectures
- Limited flexibility in balancing loss vs. nonlinearity

## Roadmap for Future Development

- Better scalability for large circuits

### Phase 3: Hybrid SiN Integration (Q3 2025)
- [ ] Develop hybrid Si-SiN platform models
- [ ] Implement low-loss SiN routing layers
- [ ] Design efficient Si-SiN coupling interfaces
- [ ] Optimize material selection per component

Architecture proposal:
```

```

### Phase 4: Advanced Features (Q4 2025)
- [ ] Machine learning optimization for gate placement

## Technical Specifications for Improvements

### Fanout>1 Architecture
```python
# Proposed API for fanout support
result = cascade_optimization(
    truth_table=tt,
    platform="Si",
    max_fanout=4,  # Allow up to 4 outputs per gate
    optimize_for="depth"  # or "power", "loss"
)
```

### Hybrid Platform Configuration
```python
# Proposed hybrid platform definition
hybrid_config = {
    "logic_layer": "Si",      # High χ³ for logic
    "routing_layer": "SiN",    # Low loss for interconnects
    "coupling_efficiency": 0.95,
    "transition_loss_dB": 0.1
}
```

## Performance Projections

### With Current System (Fanout=1, Single Material)
- Typical circuit depth: 10-15 gates
- Power consumption: 100-500 mW
- Extinction ratio: 15-25 dB

### With Proposed Improvements (Fanout>1, Hybrid)
- Expected circuit depth: 5-8 gates (50% reduction)
- Power consumption: 50-200 mW (60% reduction)
- Extinction ratio: 20-30 dB (5 dB improvement)

## Migration Path

### For Current Users
1. Continue using current system with realistic mode for production
2. Prepare designs for fanout>1 by identifying parallelizable operations
3. Plan for hybrid integration by separating logic and routing requirements
