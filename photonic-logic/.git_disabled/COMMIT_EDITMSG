fix: implement proper logic gate operations in test_cascade method

- Fixed bug where all logic gates (AND, OR, XOR) produced identical outputs
- AND gate now correctly outputs [0, 0, 0, 1] (only true when both inputs are 1)
- OR gate now correctly outputs [0, 1, 1, 1] (true when at least one input is 1)
- XOR gate now correctly outputs [0, 1, 1, 0] (true when inputs are different)
- Each gate now has its own implementation logic instead of using the same code
- Maintains 120 dB contrast ratio for all gates
- Works correctly with both hard and soft thresholding modes
